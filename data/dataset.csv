"The project management was flawless. Our dedicated manager, Alex, was always on top of things and communication was crystal clear. A bit pricey, but worth every penny for the peace of mind.",5
We are extremely disappointed with the technical skills of the junior developers assigned to us. The code was buggy and required constant oversight from our in-house team.,1
Their support team is incredibly responsive. We had a critical issue over the weekend and they had it resolved within two hours. Truly impressive.,5
The final product was delivered on time and met all our specifications. Solid work from a reliable team.,5
"Billing is a complete mess. We were overcharged for hours that were not worked, and getting it corrected has been a nightmare.",1
"The developers are technically brilliant, but their project manager seems completely overwhelmed. Deadlines were missed repeatedly due to poor planning.",2
"Good value for the price. The quality isn't top-tier, but for our budget, it's more than acceptable. You get what you pay for.",4
"They promised expertise in cloud migration, but their team was clearly learning on the job. The project was delayed by two months and went over budget.",1
The platform they provided for tracking progress is intuitive and a huge help. It makes collaboration seamless.,5
"I'm giving three stars because the developers are skilled, but the communication from the management team is severely lacking. We often felt in the dark about progress.",3
A fantastic partner for our startup. They understood our vision and delivered a high-quality MVP well within our tight deadline.,5
