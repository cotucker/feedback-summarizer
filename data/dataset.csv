"The project management was flawless. Our dedicated manager, Alex, was always on top of things and communication was crystal clear. A bit pricey, but worth every penny for the peace of mind.",5
We are extremely disappointed with the technical skills of the junior developers assigned to us. The code was buggy and required constant oversight from our in-house team.,1
Their support team is incredibly responsive. We had a critical issue over the weekend and they had it resolved within two hours. Truly impressive.,5
The final product was delivered on time and met all our specifications. Solid work from a reliable team.,5

"The developers are technically brilliant, but their project manager seems completely overwhelmed. Deadlines were missed repeatedly due to poor planning.",2
"Good value for the price. The quality isn't top-tier, but for our budget, it's more than acceptable. You get what you pay for.",4

"I'm giving three stars because the developers are skilled, but the communication from the management team is severely lacking. We often felt in the dark about progress.",3
A fantastic partner for our startup. They understood our vision and delivered a high-quality MVP well within our tight deadline.,5
The time zone difference was a much bigger issue than we anticipated. Getting timely responses to urgent questions was a constant struggle.,2
Their QA process needs a serious overhaul. We found so many obvious bugs in the final delivery that it felt like it wasn't tested at all.,1
The initial consultation was amazing. They really took the time to understand our business needs before proposing a solution.,5
"While the project was successful, the constant upselling was exhausting. Every call felt like a new sales pitch for another service.",3
